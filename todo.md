# Todo and Future Work

The original project provided a useful baseline for early stopping
methods.  The enhancements in this repository add several new
features, but there is always room for improvement.  Below are some
ideas for future development:

## Documentation and maintenance

- [ ] **Improve API docs.**  Use tools like Sphinx or MkDocs to
  automatically generate documentation from docstrings.  Include
  examples from the `examples/` folder.
- [ ] **Unify examples.**  Provide a single CLI or Jupyter notebook
  that allows users to choose between Landweber, L2 boosting,
  proximal GD, component‑wise and fairness‑aware stopping.
- [ ] **Publish PyPI package.**  Write a `setup.py`/`pyproject.toml` to
  distribute the library.  Ensure versioning and dependency
  management is clean.
- [ ] **Update GitHub Actions.**  Add workflows for continuous
  integration (linting, testing) and documentation deployment.

## Algorithmic improvements

- [ ] **Noise estimation in ill‑posed problems.**  Extend the Landweber
  implementation to compute variance quantities when the design
  matrix is ill conditioned.
- [ ] **Unified simulation wrapper.**  Provide a unified interface for
  generating synthetic data and benchmarking different early stopping
  strategies.  Include options for kernel methods, boosting,
  proximal GD, fairness and privacy.
- [ ] **Kernel misspecification.**  Implement a discrepancy principle
  that adapts to unknown kernel smoothness or model mismatch, as
  discussed in recent literature.

## New research directions

- [ ] **Multi‑objective early stopping.**  Investigate stopping rules
  that balance multiple metrics (e.g. accuracy, fairness, privacy) and
  implement Pareto‑efficient strategies.
- [ ] **Graph neural networks.**  Explore early stopping criteria for
  graph neural networks to prevent oversmoothing.
- [ ] **Federated learning.**  Build on `dp_early_stopping.py` to
  support federated settings with heterogeneous clients and local
  stopping rules.
